# groupmeSP

###How do I Markdown?

Anyway, quick little bot that will listen on Express server standard port(3000).
It picks up every message from the groupMe that it's been added to, just parses
through the text and checks to see if it should do anything. It also ignores
its own messages, as that gets stuck in a loop and can get nasty quickly.

### Plans
There's a few improvements I'd like to make to this right off the bat; for one,
the parsing could definitely use some work (it's done in a very rudimentary way)
but adding a few pieces of functionality are also on the board. A "help" would be
up there, as would upgrading the functionality behind the "rides" thing.
